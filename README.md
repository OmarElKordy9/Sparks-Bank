## Sparks Bank

## Project Description

This project is the first task from my internship in The Sparks Foundation. The website is used as a basic banking system with many features like making transaction between user and another and verifying it and creating users with all their information available with their balance as well. It is a MERN stack application that is built with animations using framer-motion, locomotive-scroll and sweetAlert2. The website is styled using styled-components. The backend part is connected to MongoDB and connected with the frontend using axios.
